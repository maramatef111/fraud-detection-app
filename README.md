# 🕵️‍♀️ Fraud Detection App

This project is a machine learning application for detecting fraudulent financial transactions using a dataset of over 6.3 million records. It includes data visualization, model training, and a deployed Streamlit app.

---

## 📊 Project Description

- This app helps identify **fraudulent transactions** from mobile money operations.
- Transaction types include: `CASH-IN`, `CASH-OUT`, `DEBIT`, `PAYMENT`, and `TRANSFER`.
- Some records were previously flagged false by existing systems — this project aims to improve detection using data analysis and machine learning.
